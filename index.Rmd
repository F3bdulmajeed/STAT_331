# Introduction {-}

Our overall **goal** in this course is meant to expose you to the techniques of drawing representative samples from various populations and then preparing you on the mathematical formulations of estimating the population parameters based on the sample data, you would also be exposed to the real life applications of
sampling techniques and estimation of parameters. Determination of sample size and selection of sample, Simple random sampling, Stratified
random sampling, Cluster sampling, Systematic sampling. textbook for this module can be found by clicking [here](https://ksusa-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/aalharbi10_ksu_edu_sa/EXiGXqS0oLNEij_721SyVh8BXcTk6m4xa69ExysLpaxBKg?e=etSYh4).
However, this note will be used for the exercise classes for the module (STAT331).  The notes have yet completed, I will still add new exercises and fix typos. If you find any typos or mistakes or have any question, I will appreciate if you email me at `Aalharbi10@ksu.edu.sa` .
