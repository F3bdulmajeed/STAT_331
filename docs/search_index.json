Exercise 6.2 Some of the school buildings in a district collapsed during last few years, and caused damage to life and property. The district administration decided to have a quick estimate of the proportion of unsafe school buildings in the district. For this purpose, a systematic sample of 84 buildings, out of a total of \\(1260\\) school buildings, was selected. The selected school buildings were examined by experts. The number of unsafe buildings was found to be \\(16\\). Estimate the proportion of unsafe buildings in the district, and work out the confidence interval for it. Solution The giving information are \\(N=1260, n=84, a =16\\) \\(p_{sy}=\\dfrac{16}{84}=0.1905\\) \\(v\\left(p_{sy}\\right)=\\frac{(N-n)p_{sy}(1-p_{sy})}{N\\ast(n-1)}=\\frac{\\left(1260-84\\right)\\ast0.1905\\ast(1-0.1905)}{1260\\ast(84-1)}=\\ 0.0017\\) \\(se\\left(p_{sy}\\right)=\\ \\sqrt{\\ 0.0017}=0.0416\\) The confidence limit for \\(P\\) is \\(p_{sy}\\pm1.96\\ast se(p_{sy})\\) \\[0.1905\\pm2\\ast0.0416\\] The C.I is \\([0.10730, 0.2737]\\) Exercise 6.3 Solve Example 6.4 by R and compare the answers with textbook: y=c(5.614,8.202,6.115,9.765,8.550,9.225,6.640,7.350,5.843, 6.875,8.460,10.850,6.970,5.524,7.847) n=length(y) N=162 sum(y) ## [1] 113.83 ybar=mean(y) ybar ## [1] 7.588667 ytotal=N*ybar ytotal ## [1] 1229.364 # compute the variance of the sample mean i = 1:(n-1 ) X= sum((y[i+1]- y[i])^2) X ## [1] 67.59603 var_sysmean= ((N-n)/(2*N*n*(n-1)))*X var_sysmean ## [1] 0.1460408 # compute the variance of sample total ytotal_var=N^2*var_sysmean ytotal_var ## [1] 3832.695 sd= sqrt(var_sysmean) sd ## [1] 0.3821529 #CI for sample total CIL=N*(ybar-(2*sd)) CIL ## [1] 1105.546 CIU=N*(ybar+(2*sd)) CIU ## [1] 1353.182 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
