List all possible samples of size 3 that can be selected from this population of 12 units using LS and CS sampling. Also, determine the average of corresponding sample means in both the cases. Are the two averages equal to the population mean? If yes, what does it indicate about the bias in the two estimators? Solution Linear systematic sampling: Random start (r) Serial y values Sample mean 1 (1, 5, 9) (8,7,6) 7.00 2 (2, 6,10) (10,9,8) 9.00 3 (3,7,11) (6,11,9) 8.67 4 (4,8,12) (7,5,11) 7.67 The average of the sample means is \\(E({\\bar{y}}_{sys})=\\ \\sum_{r=1}^{k}{\\bar{y}}_r=7+9+8.67+7.67=8.08\\) Population mean is \\(\\bar{Y}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{Y_i=}8+10++11= 8.08\\) The average of the sample means is equal to the population mean, so its unbiased estimator.

This damage persists along a \\(35 km\\) stretch. The Department of Irrigation is interested in estimating total number of these damaged trees. Each one kilometer segment along the canal has been divided into 5 equal parts by stone markers. Thus, the entire 35 km long stretch is divided into 175 equal segments. Twenty five of these segments are selected using LS sampling with a sampling interval of 7 segments. The information regarding number of uprooted trees \\((y)\\) obtained from this l-in-7 systematic sample is given in the following table: Selected y Selected y Selected y 6 4 62 3 118 23 13 17 69 8 125 12 20 11 76 5 132 8 27 6 83 13 139 17 34 8 90 9 146 6 41 16 97 16 153 5 48 21 104 17 160 8 55 13 111 9 167 10 NA NA NA NA 174 15 Estimate the total number of uprooted trees, and also determine the confidence interval for it. Solution The population size \\(N=175\\), and sampling interval \\(k=7\\). They use linear systematic sampling for the selection. Let the random number \\(r\\) selected from \\(1 to k(=7)\\) be \\(6\\). The sample mean is \\(\\bar{y}_{sys}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{y_i=}4+\\ldots\\ldots+15=\\ 11.2\\) The estimate of total number of uprooted trees is \\(y^\\prime_{sys}=N\\times~{\\bar{y}}_{sys} =1960\\).
