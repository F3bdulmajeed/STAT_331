Which of these errors are more likely to be present in a census or a sample survey?  Sampling error is the resultant discrepancy between the sample estimate and the population parameter value is the error of the estimate. Conversely, non-sampling error is arising due to defective sampling procedures, ambiguity in definitions, faulty measurement techniques, mistakes in recording, errors in coding-decoding, tabulation and analysis, etc  The sampling errors usually decreases with increase in sample size. In contrary, the nonsampling errors are likely to increase with increase in sample size. It is quite possible that nonsampling errors in a complete enumeration survey are greater than both the sampling and nonsampling errors taken together in a sample survey.

The frame used was the list of death records for the year 1992, available in the office of Registrar of Births and Deaths. There were 680 deaths of women during 1992. From these, a WR random sample of 32 deceased women was drawn. The below given information regarding the age of sample women was obtained by contacting their kith and kin.

Also, set the confidence interval for population proportion. Solution The giving information are \\(N=1400,~~ n=67,~~ a=67-46=21\\) (Because the 46 is the number of fathers were not graduates and the question asks about graduates) \\[p=\\frac{21}{67}=0.3134,~~ q=1-0.3134=0.6866\\] Unbiased estimator WOR : \\[v\\left(p\\right)=\\frac{(N-n)}{N}\\frac{pq}{n-1}=0.0031\\] \\[\\Rightarrow~ se\\left(p\\right)=\\ \\sqrt{0.0031}=0.0557\\] The confidence interval for \\(p\\) is \\(p\\pm~1.96\\times se(p)\\) The C.I is \\([0.2042,0.4226]\\) Note: rounding to the fourth decimal place.

Later, a private company released videocassette of this serial. The company has 30 centers throughout India, and each center has its dealers. In all, there are 250 dealers. After 6 months, an investigator wanted to estimate the total number of times a videocassette of the serial was hired after its introduction in the market. For this purpose, six centers were selected using WOR simple random sampling, and all the dealers in the sample centers were enumerated for the number of times videocassette tapes of the serial were hired from the dealers. The information, so obtained, is given in the following table. Estimate the average number of times a videocassette of the serial was hired from a dealer, and place confidence limits on its population value.

Since the number of such individuals was not known for each village, a WOR simple random sample of 9 villages was selected. All the persons, with age over 80 years in each selected village, were interviewed and then alertness was ranked from 0 to 10. The score of 10 was given to the persons with perfect mental alertness, whereas 0 score was meant for persons who were not in control of their mental faculties. The number of persons with age over 80 years (\\(M_j\\)) and the scores for their mental alertness, are given below for the sample villages. Estimate the average mental alertness for the population of persons aged above 80 years in the development block, and place confidence limits on this average.
