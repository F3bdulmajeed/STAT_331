List all possible samples of size 3 that can be selected from this population of 12 units using LS and CS sampling. Also, determine the average of corresponding sample means in both the cases. Are the two averages equal to the population mean? If yes, what does it indicate about the bias in the two estimators?

This damage persists along a \\(35 km\\) stretch. The Department of Irrigation is interested in estimating total number of these damaged trees. Each one kilometer segment along the canal has been divided into 5 equal parts by stone markers. Thus, the entire 35 km long stretch is divided into 175 equal segments. Twenty five of these segments are selected using LS sampling with a sampling interval of 7 segments. The information regarding number of uprooted trees \\((y)\\) obtained from this l-in-7 systematic sample is given in the following table: Selected y Selected y Selected y 6 4 62 3 118 23 13 17 69 8 125 12 20 11 76 5 132 8 27 6 83 13 139 17 34 8 90 9 146 6 41 16 97 16 153 5 48 21 104 17 160 8 55 13 111 9 167 10 NA NA NA NA 174 15 Estimate the total number of uprooted trees, and also determine the confidence interval for it.

In all, there are 192 such hotels in the state and these are listed in a book entitled A Guide to Visitors. The investigator selected a l-in-8 sample of hotels and rang up the managers of sampled hotels. The information on rent (in rupees) so obtained is given below: Hotel Rent Hotel Rent Hotel Rent 1 100 9 90 17 125 2 120 10 110 18 85 3 125 11 125 19 90 4 115 12 80 20 105 5 110 13 70 21 130 6 80 14 125 22 95 7 130 15 130 23 135 8 120 16 105 24 140 Estimate the average per day rent along with the confidence limits for it.

Compute 1. the population mean and variance. 2. Perform all 1-in-5 systematic samples (LS). 3. Compute their means. 4. Compute their variances. 5. Compute all systematic sample mean. 6. Verify that systemic mean is unbiased estimator of the population mean. 7. Compute the variance of the systematic sample mean \\(Var({\\bar{y}}_{sys})\\) 8. Compute the variance of the SRS mean \\(Var(\\bar{y})\\) with \\(n=20\\). 9. Find the relative efficiency of the variance of the simple random mean, \\(Var(\\bar{y})\\), and the variance of the systematic mean,$ Var({y}_{sys})$. Solution The population mean is \\(\\bar{Y}=20.69\\), the population variance is \\(V({\\bar{y}}_{sys})= 120.9635\\) The population size N=100, and sampling interval \\(k=5\\). We use linear systematic sampling for the selection. Let the random number \\(r\\) selected from \\(1\\) to \\(k(=5)\\). Each sample has a size of \\((n=20)\\). The systematic means for all samples are \\[20.25,\\ 22.55,\\ 20.80,\\ 18.10,\\ 21.75\\] The variances of the sample means are \\[158.7237\\ ,93.1026,\\ 119.8526,\\ 115.8842,\\ 130.6184\\] The all systematic sample mean \\({\\bar{y}}_{sys}=\\dfrac{1}{5}~ \\sum_{r=1}^{k}{\\bar{y}}_r= \\dfrac{1}{5}~(20.25+\\ldots+\\ 21.75)=\\ 20.69\\) From answer 5, the all systematic sample mean is equal to the population mean, therefore its unbiased estimator. The estimate of variance is \\(V({\\bar{y}}_{sys})= 2.2994\\) For simple random sampling without replacement with \\(n=20\\) and $ Var({y})=4.8385$ The relative efficiency of the variance of the simple random mean, \\(Var(\\bar{y})\\), and the variance of the systematic mean, \\(Var(\\bar{y}_{sys}) = 210.4263\\) which it shows that the systematic sampling estimator \\({\\bar{y}}_{sys}\\) for the given population, is \\(21.0426\\) times more efficient than the one based on SRS That can be computed using the following pieces of code set.seed(111) y = sample(1:40,100,replace=TRUE) # Compute the population mean (ybar = mean(y)) ## [1] 20.69 # Compute the population variance (yvar = var(y)) ## [1] 120.9635 # perform all 1-in-5 systematic samples k = 5 n = 20 N = 100 sys_samples = matrix(0,n,k) for(i in 1:k){ sys_samples[,i] = y[seq(i,N,k)] } print(sys_samples) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 14 20 19 25 5 ## [2,] 35 8 26 10 36 ## [3,] 8 14 26 25 24 ## [4,] 7 21 15 1 9 ## [5,] 40 25 35 7 36 ## [6,] 28 38 25 4 31 ## [7,] 6 30 5 37 6 ## [8,] 36 28 18 27 29 ## [9,] 23 32 1 16 39 ## [10,] 4 25 27 24 16 ## [11,] 15 27 29 24 30 ## [12,] 1 29 25 26 18 ## [13,] 32 19 33 25 27 ## [14,] 28 28 11 31 12 ## [15,] 31 6 39 31 6 ## [16,] 18 9 12 18 6 ## [17,] 13 5 31 6 22 ## [18,] 6 27 7 4 24 ## [19,] 23 35 26 13 23 ## [20,] 37 25 6 8 36 sys_mean = apply(sys_samples,2,mean) sys_mean ## [1] 20.25 22.55 20.80 18.10 21.75 # Compare their mean to the population mean mean(sys_mean) ## [1] 20.69 # which proves that systemic mean is unbiased estimator of the population mean. # Compute the variance of the systematic sample mean var_sys_mean = var(sys_mean)*((k-1)/k) var_sys_mean ## [1] 2.2994 # Compute the variances of the systematic samples sys_var = apply(sys_samples,2,var) mean(sys_var) ## [1] 123.6363 # Compute the variance of the SRS mean V(ybar) S = sd(y) (varSRS= (N-n)/(N*n)*S^2) ## [1] 4.838541 # The relative efficiency of the variance of the simple random mean varSRS/var_sys_mean*100 ## [1] 210.4263 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
